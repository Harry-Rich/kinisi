Uncertainty analysis and model comparison for atomistic molecular dynamics.

## Goals
- [x] Estimate uncertainties in mean-squared displacements
- [ ] Estimate uncertainties in squared mean-displacements 
- [x] Estimate uncertainties in diffusion coefficients
- [ ] Estimate uncertainties in ionic conductivities
- [ ] Estimate uncertainties in activation energies (via Arrhenius relation).
- [ ] Model comparison between Arrhenius and super-Arrhenius diffusion.
