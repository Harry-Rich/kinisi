Uncertainty analysis and model comparison for atomistic molecular dynamics.

## Goals
- [x] Estimate uncertainties in mean-squared displacements
- [x] Estimate uncertainties in mean-squared charge displacements 
- [x] Estimate uncertainties in diffusion coefficients
- [x] Estimate uncertainties in charge diffusion coefficients
- [x] Estimate uncertainties in activation energies (via Arrhenius relation).
- [x] Model comparison between Arrhenius and super-Arrhenius diffusion.
