Uncertainty analysis and model comparison for atomistic molecular dynamics.

## Goals
- Estimate uncertainties in mean-squared displacements and squared mean-displacements.
- Estimate uncertainties in diffusion coefficients and ionic conductivities.
- Estimate uncertainties in activation energies (via Arrhenius relation).
- Model comparison between Arrhenius and super-Arrhenius diffusion.
