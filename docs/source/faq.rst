- I have been using :py:mod:`kinisi` in my research and would like to cite the package, how should I do this?

    Thanks for using :py:mod:`kinisi`, we are working on a paper that you can cite in the future, but for now please use the following citation: “A. R. McCluskey & B. J. Morgan. kinisi: Uncertainty quantification in diffusion. https://github.com/bjmorgan/kinisi.”
    
- How does :py:mod:`kinisi` work?

    :py:mod:`kinisi` uses a custom bootstrap resampling approach to determine accurate uncertainties and covariances in MSD and leverages likelihood sampling of a covariant multidimensional Gaussian distribution to determine the diffusion coefficient and associated uncertainty. A paper discussing this in detail is in preparation.
